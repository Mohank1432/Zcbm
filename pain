IAM Pain Points in Divestiture

Separation of shared identities, roles, and entitlements without disrupting operations.

Residual/unauthorized access remaining across parent and divested environments.

Heavy entitlement clean-up for legacy and undocumented permissions.

Carve-out challenges for SSO, MFA, and lifecycle management workflows.

Complex directory split (AD/Entra ID) with high risk of downtime.

Mandatory large-scale access recertification to meet audit requirements.

Inconsistent access models across business units slowing standardization.

PAM account separation, credential rotation, and policy rebuilds.

Automation and IAM connectors breaking due to dependency on parent infra.

Increased security exposure during transition windows.

Licensing, tooling, and vendor contract dependencies delaying transition.
