Good outline. Based on the official CyberArk Remote Access (Shared Services) documentation — plus related components like CyberArk Privileged Access Manager (PAM) / CyberArk Identity / CyberArk Identity Security Platform Shared Services (ISPSS) — here's a suggested slide deck structure with content pointers. You can use this to build PowerPoint/Slides.

Title: “CyberArk Remote Access – Shared Services: Architecture, Onboarding & User/Vendor Flows”

Subtitle: (optional) “Secure Remote Privileged Access without VPNs”

Date, Presenter name


2. Introduction / What is Remote Access (High-level)

Definition: CyberArk Remote Access is a SaaS-based service that enables secure privileged access for remote vendors and employees — no VPNs, no agents, no passwords. 

Key features: Zero-Trust access, biometric MFA (smartphone fingerprint/face), just-in-time (JIT) provisioning, session isolation & end-to-end encryption, full audit & visibility. 

What problems it solves: reduces risk of credential exposure, removes VPN/agent complexity, simplifies vendor/vendor-tenant access management, supports compliance audits. 


3. High-Level Design (HLD) for Remote Access / RAM Architecture

Outline of components, data flow, and interactions. Key elements:

Component / Layer	Purpose / Role

Remote Access Cloud Service (SaaS)	Orchestrates authentication (biometric + QR), identity federation, just-in-time provisioning; does not store biometric data or unencrypted credentials. 
Remote Access Connector (deployed internally behind firewall)	Bridges Remote Access Cloud with internal environment (PAM / Privilege Cloud), handles encrypted session setup, validates certificates/identity, acts as SAML IdP / LDAP for vendor provisioning. 
HTML5 Gateway (inside internal network, containerised)	Translates incoming web-based connection from Remote Access into RDP (or other protocol) over TLS to target privileged systems; ensures sessions are brokered, isolated, and recorded via PAM session management. 
PAM / Privilege Cloud / Vault / Identity components	Underlying infrastructure where target systems, privileged accounts, safes, and user roles exist; defines what resources vendors/users can access. 
Identity / Role Management (via ISPSS / CyberArk Identity)	Manages user identities (employees, vendors), roles, licensing (external vendor vs internal user), integration with Active Directory (if required). 
User Devices (smartphone + workstation)	Smartphone with biometric/fingerprint/face for authentication; workstation for connection via browser — QR code generated by Remote Access portal; end user needs no VPN or local agent. 


(Consider including a block-diagram slide to show flows among these components)

HLD Notes / Considerations

Biometric data remains local to the user’s mobile device — Remote Access “does not have access to unencrypted traffic or biometric data.” 

Remote Access supports high availability by allowing multiple Remote Access Connectors per “site.” Using multiple connectors improves resilience / load balancing. 

License model: Vendors may consume External Vendor (EXTUser) or EPVUser (depending on directory mapping). Administrators must ensure correct mapping to avoid license exhaustion/misuse. 


4. What is Required to Onboard a Remote Access User (Employee or Vendor)

Prerequisites & Setup (for Admin)

Integration between Remote Access and CyberArk Identity (ISPSS) must be configured. This involves linking the tenants, setting up service user (e.g. alero-integration-user@<suffix>) and required roles. 

Download and install the CyberArk Mobile app on user’s iOS or Android device (Android v6+ with biometric and Google Services, or iOS v10+). 

Administrator logs into Remote Access Admin Portal and sends invitation (email link) or generates a QR code for “on-the-spot” registration. 

(Optional) For vendor access, define vendor-specific role in Identity Administration + assign vendors to relevant safes / target accounts in PAM / Privilege Cloud. 


Onboarding / Registration Flow (User Side)

1. User receives invitation email or admin generates QR-code. 


2. User installs CyberArk Mobile app and registers by verifying email/phone (passcode via SMS) + enzyme own identity (biometric). 


3. User scans QR code (one-time, short-lived) on workstation to link the session. 


4. Upon successful scan + biometric authentication, user’s Remote Access account is activated — they appear in Admin’s Users list as Activated. 



5. End-User Access Flow (Day-to-day)

Describe typical workflow when a remote user (employee or vendor) wants to access a privileged resource:

1. User opens browser and navigates to the organization’s Remote Access portal / PVWA (or Privilege Cloud) URL. 


2. Portal presents a one-time, time-limited QR code. 


3. User opens CyberArk Mobile app on smartphone, scans the QR, and completes biometric authentication (face/fingerprint). 


4. Upon successful authentication, secure session is established via Remote Access Connector + HTML5 Gateway; user obtains access to the permitted privileged account / target system. Credentials are vaulted, not exposed to user’s workstation. 


5. The session is isolated, encrypted end-to-end, audited and logged by PAM. Admins have visibility to all remote access actions. 



6. Vendor Management Flow

For third-party/vendor users (non-employees) — adding, managing, and de-provisioning. Suggested slide(s):

Invite vendor (via email link or QR) from Remote Access Admin Portal. 

Assign vendor a dedicated “Vendor Remote Access” role (or similar) in Identity Admin; map to correct license type (External Vendor / EPVUser) based on directory mapping. 

Assign vendor role to relevant “Safes” or target accounts in PAM / Privilege Cloud so they have access only to necessary resources — adhering to least privilege principle. 

Optionally configure connectors, HTML5 Gateway, and SIA (if using that method) to support vendor access. 

After access period/expires or vendor no longer required, deactivate or delete the vendor from Users list; license is freed. 

Best practices: have more than one tenant admin to avoid single point of failure; validate directory mapping & license consumption; consider multiple connectors for HA / load-balancing; periodically review vendor activity. 


7. Use Case: Secure File Transfer (Example)

Illustrate how you might use Remote Access to enable secure file transfers by a vendor or remote user (instead of full RDP/interactive sessions). For instance:

Vendor needs to transfer files to an internal server — instead of granting VPN or open network access, you can provision just-in-time access via Remote Access + HTML5 Gateway / Privileged Session Manager (PSM).

Using Remote Access, the session is encrypted end-to-end; credentials remain vaulted and never exposed to vendor workstation. Activities (file upload/download) occur within the isolated session, logged and auditable.

Once file transfer is done, session ends; access can be limited to a specific number of sessions or time window (just-in-time), minimizing persistent access.

Ensures “least privilege”, auditability, and reduces risk compared to traditional VPN or direct account-based access.


You may also add a workflow diagram: Invite vendor → Onboard → Grant safe/target + file access permissions → Vendor logs in via Remote Access → Establish HTML5 session → Transfer files via secured session → Session closed → Vendor deprovisioned.

8. Additional Considerations & Recommendations (Beyond Requested)

Licensing & Directory Mapping: Ensure correct license types (EXTUser vs EPVUser) depending on vendor or employee — mis-mapping can lead to license over-consumption. 

High Availability & Redundancy: Deploy multiple Remote Access Connectors per site, possibly behind load-balancer, to avoid single point of failure. 

Segregation of Duties & Role-based Access: Define roles carefully — vendor roles should have minimal privileges, only to required safes/targets; avoid giving vendor invitation rights broadly unless needed. 

Session Auditing & Monitoring: Leverage PAM / Privilege Cloud session recording and logging to maintain full traceability. 

De-provisioning and Lifecycle Management: Regularly review and deactivate vendor access when not needed; remove inactive users, free licenses. 

Security of Mobile Devices & MFA: Since access depends on biometric + mobile device, enforce device security policies (e.g. device encryption, lock screen), enforce re-authentication intervals (configurable, default 30 days) for added security.
