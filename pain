IAM Pain Points in Divestiture

Separation of shared identities, roles, and entitlements without disrupting operations.

Residual/unauthorized access remaining across parent and divested environments.

Heavy entitlement clean-up for legacy and undocumented permissions.

Carve-out challenges for SSO, MFA, and lifecycle management workflows.

Complex directory split (AD/Entra ID) with high risk of downtime.

Mandatory large-scale access recertification to meet audit requirements.

Inconsistent access models across business units slowing standardization.

PAM account separation, credential rotation, and policy rebuilds.

Automation and IAM connectors breaking due to dependency on parent infra.

Increased security exposure during transition windows.

Licensing, tooling, and vendor contract dependencies delaying transition.


IAM Activities (Workstreams / BAU)

Identity lifecycle management (Joiner–Mover–Leaver).

Application onboarding and access provisioning.

Role/entitlement modelling and periodic access reviews.

SSO/MFA integration and authentication management.

Privileged Access Management operations.

Directory and identity store management (AD/Entra ID).

Access issue resolution, incident support & BAU operations.

Compliance reporting and audit support.

Connector maintenance, workflow tuning & policy updates.

IAM Outcomes (Automation & AI Driven)

AI-powered access recommendations to minimize manual approvals.

Automated user onboarding through workflow orchestration & rule-based provisioning.

Conversational chatbot for access requests, app onboarding queries & password resets.

Self-service identity portal with AI-guided access suggestions and faster fulfillment.

AI-based anomaly detection for risky access and unusual user behavior.

Predictive access modelling to reduce role explosion and entitlement creep.

Automated access reviews with ML-based risk scoring to reduce recertification fatigue.

Service Center–enabled IAM operations with standardized SLAs and automated routing.

Automated PAM rotations & privileged session monitoring using ML-driven alerts.

Continuous compliance automation via AI engines that flag violations proactively.

End-to-end workflow automation reducing manual IAM effort and operational overhead.


Here are **concise, PPT-ready outcome points** tailored specifically to **what Delinea PAM can actually deliver today** (based on Delinea Iris AI, Analytics, Vaulting, JIT PAM, and policy automation).

---

## **Delinea PAM – AI & Automation Outcomes (PPT Ready)**

* **AI-driven privileged behavior analytics (PBA)** to detect anomalies, unusual commands, and abnormal access patterns in real time.
* **Risk-based adaptive access** using Delinea Iris AI to dynamically allow, challenge, or restrict privileged access.
* **Automated discovery and classification** of privileged, service, and machine accounts across the environment.
* **Automated password and secret rotation** with policy-driven reconciliation to eliminate manual effort.
* **Just-In-Time (JIT) privileged access** reducing standing privileges and limiting exposure windows.
* **AI-enhanced session monitoring** with intelligent alerts and automated policy responses for suspicious activities.
* **Centralized lifecycle management for machine identities** (API keys, service accounts, AI-service identities).
* **Continuous compliance automation** with auto-generated privileged access audit trails and session evidence.
* **Workflow automation for break-glass access** with built-in recording, alerts, and automatic post-session clean-up.
* **Service Center enabled PAM operations** with standardized SLAs, automated routing, and policy-driven approvals.
